Your response goes here!

1: I have learned about the <hr> element. I didn't know that it was that easy to set up a simple and clean divider.

2: The whole project was pretty easy, I enjoyed recreating everything.

3: The most difficult part was definitely trying to eyeball the correct styles.

4: I was unsure how to create the horizontal line at the bottom, so I referred to the classroom and it tipped me off to search for "html horizontal rule" and it was just that easy.
